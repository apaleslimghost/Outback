\section{Conflict resolution}
You and your opponent roll dice to see who succeeds. Your oppenent could be the
GM, rolling for an NPC or the environment, or it could be another player.

Each of you rolls a \die{d12}, adding any appropriate modifiers. If the result
is 12 or higher, mark down ``12'' somewhere, and roll again. Once your roll and
modifier is less than 12, stop rolling. Add up all your twelves and your final
roll, and that's your score. If your score is greater than your opponent's, you
succeeds; otherwise, your opponent succeeds.

Depending on the roll, the difference between the scores could factor into the
result, so keep a note of it. 

\subsection{Dividing and rounding}
Sometimes, we need to half a number, or divide. We don't want fractions, so we
\emph{round down}. When rounding down, remove the fractional part from the
number, so all numbers get closer to zero: 3{1/2} rounded down is 3, while -2{1/2}
rounded down is -2.

\section{Stats}
The three stats that sum up a character's ability are \stat{Brains} (problem
solving, navigation, repair,  etc), \stat{Brawn} (physical strength, taking a
hit, running, jumping, etc) and \stat{Wit} (quick thinking, driving,
initiative, bartering, etc).

When making a roll that requires a particular skill, add your modifier for the
appropriate stat to each roll. The GM will decide which stat is appropriate,
depending on how you roleplay going about the task.

\begin{wraptable}[12]{r}{0.13\textwidth}
\vspace*{-3ex}
\hspace*{-3ex}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  Stat  & Modifier \\
  \hline 
  0     & -5       \\
  1-2   & -4       \\
  3-4   & -3       \\
  5-6   & -2       \\
  7-8   & -1       \\
  9-10  &  0       \\
  11-12 & +1       \\
  13-14 & +2       \\
  15-16 & +3       \\
  17-18 & +4       \\
  19-20 & +5
\end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}

These stats are ordinarily from 0 to 20; modifiers run from -5 to +5. Calculate
your modifier by adding 1 and halving (rounding down) then subtracting 5, or by
using the table.

\subsection{Vehicles}
Vehicles have separate sets of stats: \stat{Speed}, \stat{Handling},
\stat{Acceleration}, stat{Braking}, \stat{Armour} and \stat{Weight}. A vehicle
is just the sum of its parts. Each part confers stats to the vehicle's total,
and can be upgraded separately: swap out your engine, and your Acceleration
could go up; new tyres might improve your Handling. 

\stat{Speed} is not an ordinary stat. It's not 0-20 like the others, but from 0
to your vehicle's \stat{Maximum Speed}. It changes as you man\oe{}uvre your
vehicle. Convert it to a 0-20 stat by dividing by 10 (just remove the last
number), and to a modifier from the stat in the usual way.

\subsection{Combined modifiers}
Sometimes, such as when rolling for Driving checks, you combine two
modifiers. To do this, take the average of the two modifiers (add them
together and half the total), rounding down. For example, if your \stat{Wit}
modifier is +4 and your vehicle's \stat{Handling} is +2, the combined modifier
is +3. +4 and -3 combined is 0.

\section{Combat}
Time in combat is broken down into \emph{ticks}, an abstract time period that
can be taken to be approximately one second. During a tick, all parties that
can do take action simultaneously. An \emph{action} could be making an attack,
man\oe{}ving your vehicle, or something else.

\begin{wraptable}[7]{l}{0.13\textwidth}
\vspace*{-3ex}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  Cooldown & Ticks \\
  \hline 
  Instant  & 1     \\
  Quick    & 2     \\
  Steady   & 3     \\
  Slow     & 5     \\
  Long     & 8
\end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}

Each action has a \emph{cooldown} period, which is a number of ticks before you
can take action again. This includes the current tick, so after an
\emph{instant} action, you can move in the next tick. The possible cooldown
lengths are shown in the table.

\subsection{Man\oe{}vring}
Some actions are called \emph{man\oe{}uvres}. These involve changes to the speed,
heading, position, etc.\ of your vehicle. Man\oe{}uvres are taken like ordinary
actions, but do not have effect until the end of the tick. All man\oe{}uvres in a
tick execute simultaneously.

You do not always have to choose between action an man\oe{}uvre: if you have
already taken a non-man\oe{}uvre action, you can still take an Instant
man\oe{}uvre in the same tick.
