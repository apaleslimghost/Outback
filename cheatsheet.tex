\section{Conflict resolution}
You and your opponent roll dice to see who succeeds. Your oppenent could be the
GM, rolling for an NPC or the environment, or it could be another player. Each
of you rolls a \die{d12}, adding any appropriate modifiers. If the result is 12
or higher, mark down ``12'' somewhere, and roll again. Once your roll and
modifier is less than 12, stop rolling. Add up all your twelves and you final
roll, and that's your score. If your score is greater than your
opponent's, you succeeds; otherwise, your opponent succeeds. The difference
between the scores could factor into the result, depending on the roll, so keep
a note of it.
