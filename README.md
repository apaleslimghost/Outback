# Outback [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/quarterto/Outback/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=e9437c29f3bdd5453a2715f8752037cc0f21aead)](https://circleci.com/gh/quarterto/Outback/tree/master)

An RPG system for fast-paced wasteland car chases and mad characters.

At least, that's the goal. Let's see how playtest two goes.

## Building

You'll need TeXLive 2015 or newer, `latexmk`, and copies of the fonts AgencyFB Black, REDRUM and DIN Next LT Pro Light, Medium & Heavy. Run `scripts/tlinstall.sh` to install TeX dependencies and `latexmk -xelatex` to build the PDF.

Or let the [CI server](https://circleci.com/gh/quarterto/outback) do it, it's already set up.

## Licence

Outback will eventually be licenced under a permissive licence if I decide to go anywhere with it (and that WB don't care). For now it's &copy; 2016 Matt Brennan, all rights reserved.
