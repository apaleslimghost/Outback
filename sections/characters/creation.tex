First, generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} roll \die{5d4} for each stat \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Points:} choose three from 6 to 17, totalling no more than 40 \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Array:} assign 9, 14 and 17 to your stats

Your \emph{maximum HP} is 3 times your \stat{Brawn}. Next, choose three skills from the list to become \emph{trained} in. The modifier for these skills increases by \textbf{1}. Finally, starting with 200 scrap, buy equipment from the list.
