First, generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} for each stat, roll \die{2d4} and subtract another \die{2d4} \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Points:} choose three from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, totalling no more than 1 \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Array:} assign \textbf{-5}, \textbf{0}, and \textbf{+6} to your stats

To calculate your \emph{maximum hit points}, roll \stat{Brawn} and add 12 to the total. If your \stat{Brawn} increases, you may reroll your maximum. Finally, starting with \textbf{300} scrap, buy equipment from the list.
