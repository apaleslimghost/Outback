When conceiving your character, think about how they would answer the following questions. Either pick one from the lists, randomly or at your choice, or come up with your own answers.

\begin{tabular}{$L{0.29\linewidth}^L{0.29\linewidth}^L{0.29\linewidth}}
\rowstyle{\bfseries}
What's been taken from you? & What do you need instead? & What's getting in your way? \\
\hline \\*[-2.5ex]
Family                      & Solace in the desert      & I can't trust my own sanity \\
Freedom and agency          & Help my fellow prisoners  & The warlord controls everything \\
The way home                & Somewhere I can call mine & Ain't nothing but dust out here \\
\end{tabular}

Generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} for each stat, roll \die{2d4} and subtract another \die{2d4} \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Points:} choose three from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, totalling no more than 1 \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Array:} assign \textbf{-3}, \textbf{0}, and \textbf{+4} to your stats

To calculate your \emph{maximum hit points}, roll \stat{Brawn} and add 12 to the total. If your \stat{Brawn} increases, you may reroll your maximum. Finally, starting with \textbf{300} scrap, buy equipment from the list.
