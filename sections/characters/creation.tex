When conceiving your character, think about how they would answer the following questions. Either pick one from the lists, randomly or at your choice, or come up with your own answers.

\begin{tabular}{L{0.29\linewidth} L{0.29\linewidth} L{0.29\linewidth}}
\rowstyle{\bfseries}
What's been taken from you? & What are you trying to find instead? & What's getting in your way? \\
\hline
My family                   & Peace in the desert                  & I need a vehicle that can cross the Wasteland 
\end{tabular}

Generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} for each stat, roll \die{2d4} and subtract another \die{2d4} \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Points:} choose three from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, totalling no more than 1 \\*[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Array:} assign \textbf{-4}, \textbf{0}, and \textbf{+5} to your stats

To calculate your \emph{maximum hit points}, roll \stat{Brawn} and add 12 to the total. If your \stat{Brawn} increases, you may reroll your maximum. Finally, starting with \textbf{300} scrap, buy equipment from the list.
