When conceiving your character, think about how they would answer the following questions. Either pick one from the lists, randomly or at your choice, or come up with your own answers.

\begin{tabular}{$L{0.29\linewidth}^L{0.29\linewidth}^L{0.29\linewidth}}
\rowstyle{\bfseries}
What's been taken from you? & What do you need instead? & What's getting in your way? \\
\hline \\*[-2.5ex]
Family                      & Solace in the desert      & I can't trust my own sanity \\
Freedom                     & Help my fellow prisoners  & Warlord controls everything \\
Home                        & Somewhere I can call mine & Ain't nothing but dust out here \\
\end{tabular}

Generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} for each stat, roll \die{5d4}, discard the lowest, and subtract \textbf{10} \\
\textbf{Points:} choose three from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, totalling no more than \textbf{2} \\
\textbf{Array:} assign \textbf{+4}, \textbf{+2}, and \textbf{-4} to your stats

To find your \emph{maximum hit points}, look up your \stat{Brawn} on the Static Rolls table and add \textbf{12} to the result. If your \stat{Brawn} increases, your maximum hit points increasesa. Finally, starting with \textbf{300} scrap, buy equipment from the list.
