When conceiving your character, think about how they would answer the following questions. Here's a few examples to give you ideas:

{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{$L{0.209\linewidth}^L{0.33\linewidth}^L{0.33\linewidth}}
\rowstyle{\bfseries}
What's been taken from you? & What do you need instead? & What's getting in your way? \\
\hline \\*[-2.5ex]
Family                      & Solace in the desert      & I can't trust my own sanity \\
Freedom                     & Help my fellow prisoners  & Warlord controls everything \\
Home                        & Somewhere I can call mine & Ain't nothing but dust out here \\
\end{tabular}}

Generate your stats in one of the following ways:

\textbf{Dice:} for each stat, roll \die{5d4}, discard the lowest, and subtract \textbf{10} \\
\textbf{Points:} choose three from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, totalling no more than \textbf{2} \\
\textbf{Array:} assign \textbf{+4}, \textbf{+2}, and \textbf{-4} to your stats

To find your \emph{maximum hit points}, look up your \stat{Brawn} on the Static Rolls table and add \textbf{12} to the result. If your \stat{Brawn} increases, your max HP increases. Finally, starting with \textbf{160} scrap, buy equipment from the list.
