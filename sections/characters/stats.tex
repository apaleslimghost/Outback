The three stats that sum up a character's ability are \stat{Brains}, \stat{Brawn} and \stat{Wit}. Most of the time, these will be from 0 to 20, with a modifier from -5 to +5. A character's \stat{Maximum HP} is equal to 3 times their \stat{Brawn} stat.

Your character might be \emph{trained} in certain skills. For rolls with these skills, add 1 to the usual modifier.
