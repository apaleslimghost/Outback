\begin{abstractsection}{Conflict resolution}
When undertaking a difficult task, you and your opponent roll dice to see who succeeds. Your oppenent is usually the GM, rolling for an NPC or the environment, or it could be another player.

Each of you rolls a \die{d12}. If the result is 12 or higher, write down ``12'', and roll again. Once your roll and modifier is less than 12, stop rolling. Add up the twelves and the final roll, and that's the score. If your score is greater than your opponent's, you succeed; otherwise, your opponent succeeds.
