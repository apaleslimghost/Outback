When undertaking a task that requires skill, you roll dice to see if you succeed. Your roll will be \emph{opposed}, usually by the GM, rolling for an NPC or the environment, or perhaps by another player, countering your skill with their skill or difficulty. The skills you use fall into three categories, which are the three \emph{stats} that sum up your character's ability:

\input{sections/characters/skills}

Normally, each stat is between \textbf{0} and \textbf{20}, and has a modifier between \textbf{-5} and \textbf{+5}. In these rules, a skill is written as \stat{Stat (Skill)}, e.g. \stat{Brains (Lore)}.

\begin{abstractsection}{Dice rolls}
You and your opponent roll a \die{d12}, adding the modifier for the skill you are using. If the total is less than 12, that's your final score. If it's 12 or more, mark down a ``12'' somewhere, and roll again. Keep going until your roll is less than 12. Add all your twelves and your final roll together to get your final score.

If your score is higher than your opponent's, you succeed. If they are equal or yours is lower, you fail.
