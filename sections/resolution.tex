Leaping between speeding vehicles! Throwing sand into somebody's eyes, or air intake! Shooting out tyres with nothing but a derringer! When trying to do something difficult, you need to roll to find out if you succeed.

Your character can do something in one of three ways. You can act forcefully, with \stat{Brawn}. You can think about it and use your \stat{Brains}. Or you could be quick on your feet or tongue using \stat{Wit}. These are your three \emph{stats}, which are numbers from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}.

Describe how you go about your difficult task, and the GM will ask for a roll in one of the stats. Your roll will be \emph{opposed}: an NPC controlled by the GM, another player, or the fickle wasteland gets to oppose your roll with their own luck.

Each of you rolls a \die{d12} and adds their stat. The opponent stops there, but if your roll plus stat is 12 or more, mark down a ``12'', and roll again. Keep rolling until the score is than 12, then add all your twelves and your final roll together to get your total.

If your total is higher than your opponent's, you succeed. If they're equal or yours is lower, you fail.
