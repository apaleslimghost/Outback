Leaping between speeding vehicles! Throwing sand into somebody's eyes, or air intake! Shooting out tyres with nothing but a derringer! When trying to do something difficult, you need to roll to find out if you succeed.

Your character can do something in one of three ways. You can act forcefully, with \stat{Brawn}. You can think about it and use your \stat{Brains}. Or you could be quick on your feet or tongue using \stat{Wit}. These are your three \emph{stats}, which are numbers from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}.

Describe how you go about your difficult task, and the GM will ask for a roll in one of the stats. Your roll will be \emph{opposed}: an NPC controlled by the GM, another player, or the fickle wasteland gets to oppose your roll with their own luck.

You each roll a \die{d12} and add your stats. If the roll plus stat is 12 or more, mark down a ``12'', and roll again. Keep rolling until the score is less than 12, then add all the twelves and the final roll together to get the total. If your total is higher than the opponent's, you succeed. If they're equal or yours is lower, you fail.
