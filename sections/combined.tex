Some rolls make use of two skills, or your skill and your vehicle's stats. We'll write this as \stat{Stat 1 (Skill 1) + Stat 2 (Skill 2)} (or \stat{Stat (Skill) + Vehicle Stat}) The modifier for these rolls is the average of the two original modifiers; that is, add them together and divide by two (rounding towards zero).

For example, if your \stat{Wit} modifier is \textbf{+4} and your vehicle's \stat{Handling} is \textbf{+1}, then the combined modifier \stat{Wit (Driving) + Handling} is \textbf{+2}.
