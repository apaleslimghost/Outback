Some rolls use of two skills, or your skill and your vehicle's stats. We'll write this as \combined{\stat[Skill 1]{Stat 1}}{\stat[Skill 2]{Stat 2}} (or \combined{\stat[Skill]{Stat}}{\stat{Vehicle Stat}}) The modifier for these rolls is the average of the two original modifiers; that is, add them together and divide by two (rounding towards zero).
