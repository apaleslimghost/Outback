Some rolls make use of two skills, or your skill and your vehicle's stats. We'll write this as \combined{\stat[Skill 1]{Stat 1}}{\stat[Skill 2]{Stat 2}} (or \combined{\stat[Skill]{Stat}}{\stat{Vehicle Stat}}) The modifier for these rolls is the average of the two original modifiers; that is, add them together and divide by two (rounding towards zero).

For example, if your \stat{Wit} modifier is \textbf{+4} and your vehicle's \stat{Handling} is \textbf{+1}, then the combined modifier \combined{\stat[Driving]{Wit}}{\stat{Handling}} is \textbf{+2}.
