A combat roll is an offensive skill, such as \stat{Brawn (Melee weapons)}, versus a defensive skill, e.g.\ \stat{Wit (Agility)}. If the attacker succeeds, the defender takes damage equal to the difference between the rolls. Each weapon has a maximum damage.

Time in combat is broken down into \emph{ticks}, an abstract time period that can be taken to be roughly a second. In each tick, players declare actions, which happen simultaneously.

\begin{tabular}{cc}
  Cooldown & Ticks \\
  \hline
  Instant  & 1     \\
  Quick    & 2     \\
  Steady   & 3     \\
  Slow     & 5     \\
  Long     & 8
\end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}

Every action has a \emph{cooldown}, which is a number of ticks before you can act again. This includes the current tick, so after an \emph{Instant} action you can move in the next tick.
