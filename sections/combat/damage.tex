Attacks to a vehicle damage the vehicle, not its occupants, unless the attack states otherwise. Certain attacks can cause \emph{afflictions}. These are statuses that adversely affect your vehicle's stats and can only be removed by a character trained in \stat{Repair}.

When a character reaches zero hit points, something bad happens.

When a vehicle reaches zero hit points, it is afflicted by \emph{engine fire} and cannot be man\oe{}uvred. If the fire is repaired in 5 ticks, the engine explodes, killing any occupants.
