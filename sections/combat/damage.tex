Attacks to a vehicle damage the vehicle, not its occupants, unless the attack states otherwise. Certain attacks cause \emph{afflictions}. These are statuses that can adversely affect your stats.

When a character reaches zero hit points, they're afflicted by \emph{unconsciousness}. Unconscious characters cannot act, and if the affliction isn't removed in 13 ticks, they die. When a vehicle reaches zero hit points, it's afflicted by \emph{engine fire} and cannot be man\oe{}uvred. If the fire isn't repaired in 5 ticks, the engine explodes, killing any occupants.

\begin{abstractsection}{Repair}
To restore HP to a vehicle or character, roll a \die{d8} and add your \stat{Brains}. Add the result to the target's HP. Note that if your modifier is negative, you might end up doing damage! To remove an affliction, roll \stat{Brains} versus its \stat{Difficulty}. For a vehicle affliction, a full set of tools is required. If you succeed, the affliction is removed. Both these actions have \duration{\durationLong} cooldown.
