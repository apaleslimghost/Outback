When you take an attack action, you roll to see if you hit. An attack roll is an offensive skill, such as \stat[Melee weapons]{Brawn}, versus a defensive skill, e.g.\ \stat[Agility]{Wit}. If the attacker succeeds, the attack hits. The defender takes damage equal to the difference between the attacking and defending rolls, up to a maximum depending on the weapon.
