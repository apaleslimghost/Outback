When you take the Attack action, you roll to see if you hit. An attack roll is an offensive skill, such as \stat{Brawn (Melee weapons)}, versus a defensive skill, e.g.\ \stat{Wit (Agility)}. If the attacker succeeds, the attack hits, and the defender takes damage equal to the difference between the rolls. Each weapon has a maximum damage.
