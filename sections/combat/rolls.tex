Close-range weapons and bare knuckles attack with \stat{Brawn}, and long-range weapons attack using \stat{Brains}. For both, the defender opposes with \stat{Wit}. If the attacker succeeds, the attack hits, and the defender takes damage equal to the difference between the attacking and defending rolls, up to a maximum depending on the weapon.
