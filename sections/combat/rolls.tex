Close-range weapons and bare knuckles attack with \stat{\statPhysical}, and long-range weapons attack using \stat{\statMental}; the defender opposes with \stat{\statSkill}. If the attacker succeeds, the attack hits, and the defender takes damage equal to the difference between the two rolls, up to a maximum depending on the weapon.
