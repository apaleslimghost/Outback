A hand-to-hand attack roll is the attacker's \stat{Brawn (Hand-to-hand or Melee Weapons)} against the defender's \stat{Brawn (Armour)} or \stat{Wit (Agility)}. A ranged weapon attack roll has \stat{Brains (Ranged Weapons)} as the offensive skill.

With a melee weapon, or unarmed, you can only attack a combatant within 3 feet of you, unless the weapon states otherwise. Ranged weapons specify their maximum range.
