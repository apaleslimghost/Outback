A hand-to-hand attack roll is the attacker's \stat[Hand-to-hand \textmd{or} Melee Weapons]{Brawn} against the defender's \stat[Armour]{Brawn} or \stat[Agility]{Wit}. A ranged weapon attack roll has \stat[Ranged Weapons]{Brains} as the offensive skill.

With a melee weapon, or unarmed, you can only attack a combatant within 3 feet of you, unless the weapon states otherwise. Ranged weapons specify their maximum range.
