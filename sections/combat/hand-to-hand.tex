Hand-to-hand attacks use one of two skills: \stat[Unarmed]{Brawn} or \stat[Melee Weapons]{Brawn}. Ranged weapons use \stat[Ranged Weapons]{Brains}. The defender can use \stat[Armour]{Brawn} or \stat[Agility]{Wit} to defend against an attack. Ranged weapons can target vehicles, which defend with \stat{Ruggedness}.

Hand-to-hand attacks can only target a combatant within 3 feet of you, unless the weapon states otherwise. Ranged weapons specify their maximum range.

As an \duration{\durationInstant} man\oe{}uvre, a character on foot can run up to 15 + \stat[Athletics]{Brawn} feet.
