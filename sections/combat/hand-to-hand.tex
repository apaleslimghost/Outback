A hand-to-hand attack roll is \stat[Hand-to-hand]{Brawn} \orr \stat[Melee Weapons]{Brawn} versus \stat[Armour]{Brawn} \orr \stat[Agility]{Wit}. A ranged weapon attack roll has \stat[Ranged Weapons]{Brains} as the offensive skill.

With a melee weapon, or unarmed, you can only attack a combatant within 3 feet of you, unless the weapon states otherwise. Ranged weapons specify their maximum range.

As an \duration{1} man\oe{}uvre, a character on foot can run up to 15 + \stat[Athletics]{Brawn} feet.
