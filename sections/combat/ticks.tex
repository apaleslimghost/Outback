Time in combat is broken down into \emph{ticks}, an abstract time period that can be taken to be roughly a second. In each tick, every player that can act declares an \emph{action}. All the players' actions then happen simultaneously.

Every action has a \emph{cooldown}, which is a number of ticks before you can act again. This includes the current tick, so after an \emph{Instant} action you can move in the next tick.
