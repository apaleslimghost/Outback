\begin{abstractsection}{Man\oe{}uvring}
\emph{Man\oe{}uvres} are actions that move you around the battlefield: running, accelerating, braking and so on. They are taken like ordinary actions, except all man\oe{}uvres execute at the end of the tick.

You do not always have to choose between action and man\oe{}uvre: even if you have taken a non-man\oe{}uvre action, you can still take an Instant man\oe{}uvre in the same tick. However, if you're in the cooldown of another action, you cannot man\oe{}uvre.

Most man\oe{}uvres do not require a roll to succeed, but it does take skill to get the best out of your vehicle. For some man\oe{}uvres, you roll dice to determine how great an effect they have.
