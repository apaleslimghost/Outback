\let\s\stat
\let\xs\scriptsize

Exactly one of each part is required. Each part contributes to one or two stats of your vehicle: add together the numbers for each stat from each part. For example, to find your vehicle's \stat{Acceleration}, add the values from the Engine and Aspiration rows. A vehicle's \stat{Max HP} is 5 times its \stat{Ruggedness}.

When creating a vehicle for a new character, it can cost at most 400 scrap.

\begin{abstractsection}{Vehicle upgrades}
  When you have access to a garage, for example in a stronghold, you may upgrade your vehicle's parts. An upgrade takes a day to complete, and costs the difference between the old and new parts plus 20 scrap, so upgrading from \emph{Basic} to \emph{Improved} costs 50 scrap, or from \emph{Improved} to \emph{Finest} costs 70 scrap.
\end{abstractsection}

\begin{abstractsection}{Extra parts}
These parts don't replace the standard parts of your vehicle and provide extra capability or specialisation.

\begin{describe}{Bull horns}
  \prop{Cost}{50 scrap}
  \prop{Weight}{1}
  A pair of spiked bull bars to fit on the front grille of your vehicle. Your maximum damage for \emph{Shunt} and \emph{Ram} attacks increases by 10.
\end{describe}

\begin{describe}{Wheel spikes}
  \prop{Cost}{30 scrap}
  Barbs fitted to your wheel rims. When you succeed a \emph{Sideswipe} attack, the target makes an extra \stat{Ruggedness} roll versus your original attack score. If you succeed, the target is affected by a \emph{Blowout}.
\end{describe}

\begin{describe}{Nitrous boost}
  \prop{Cost}{100 scrap}
  \prop{Refill}{10 scrap}
  A single-use tank of N\textsubscript{2}O. It can be used in an \duration{1} man\oe{}uvre to immediately increase your \stat{Speed} by 40.
\end{describe}
