\let\s\stat
\let\xs\scriptsize

Exactly one of each part is required. Each part contributes to one or two stats of your vehicle: add together the numbers for each stat from each part. For example, to find your vehicle's \stat{Speed}, add the values from the Engine and Transmission rows. To find a vehicle's \stat{Max HP}, add 12 to its \stat{Ruggedness} and multiply by 5. When creating a new vehicle, it can cost at most 360 scrap.

\begin{abstractsection}{Vehicle upgrades}
  When you have access to a garage, you may upgrade your vehicle's parts. An upgrade takes a day to complete, and costs the difference between the old and new parts plus 20 scrap; for example, upgrading from \emph{Basic} to \emph{Finest} costs 100 scrap, or from \emph{Improved} to \emph{Finest} costs 70 scrap.
