Vehicles require fuel and weapons require ammunition. At the end of each setpiece, roll to see if you're out of ammo or gas, using \stat{Brains} versus the \stat{Difficulty} of not running out.

When you're out of gasoline, your vehicle sputters to a halt, leaving its convoy. Out of bullets, and your gun makes an embarrasing clicking sound; as an action, you can discard it.
