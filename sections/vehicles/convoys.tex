When in combat, vehicles form \emph{convoys}. Place tokens for each vehicle on the table and group their convoys together.

Within a convoy, vehicles and characters can freely move amongst themselves. Moving between convoys might be difficult and can only happen at the end of the setpiece. As the last action in a setpiece, a driver can try to move between convoys.

The GM determines if the convoy is difficult to move to. If it's a friendly convoy that's nearby, you'll have no problem. However, if it's hostile to you, you'll contest your \stat{Handling} against theirs, or if it's moving too fast or in the wrong direction, you need to use your \stat{Acceleration} against their \stat{Speed}. A convoy is only as strong as its weakest member, so the opposing roll's stat is the lowest of that stat in the convoy.
