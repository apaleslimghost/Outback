When in combat, vehicles form \emph{convoys}. Use

Within a convoy, vehicles and characters can freely move amongst themselves. Moving between convoys might be difficult and can only happen at the end of the setpiece. As the last action in a setpiece, a driver can try to move between convoys.

The GM determines if the convoy is difficult to move to, such as if it's hostile to you, or moving too fast or in the wrong direction. The roll to enter the convoy is \stat{Handling} or \stat{Acceleration} against the lowest \stat{Handling} or \stat{Speed} in the convoy.
