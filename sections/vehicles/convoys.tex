In combat, vehicles form \emph{convoys}. Place tokens for each vehicle on the table and group their convoys together. Within a convoy, vehicles and characters can freely move amongst themselves. As the last action in a setpiece, drivers can try to move between convoys; the GM determines if the convoy is difficult to move to.

If the convoy's moving too fast or in the wrong direction, you need to contest your \stat{Speed} against theirs. If it's at the same speed and direction as you, but hostile, you'll have to use your \stat{Handling} against theirs. It won't be difficult to move to a friendly convoy at the same speed as you. A convoy is only as strong as its weakest member, so the opposing roll's stat is the lowest of that stat in the convoy.
