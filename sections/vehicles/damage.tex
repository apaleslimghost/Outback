\subsubsection{Damage \& afflictions}
Attacks to a vehicle damage the vehicle, not its occupants, unless the attack states otherwise. Certain attacks can cause \emph{afflictions}. These are statuses such as \emph{blowout} that adversely affect your vehicle's stats.

When a vehicle reaches zero hit points, it is afflicted by \emph{engine fire} and cannot be man\oe{}uvred. If the fire is not dealt with in 5 ticks, the engine explodes, killing any occupants.
