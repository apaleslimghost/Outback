\subsection{Combat}
When making a driving-related dice roll, combine your \stat{Wit (Driving)} modifier with the stat modifier from the vehicle. A vehicular attack is normally \stat{Wit (Driving) + Speed} versus \stat{Wit (Driving) + Ruggedness}.

Vehicles are tracked on the road by three variables: \emph{position}, \emph{speed} and \emph{direction}. Position and direction are always relative. At the end of each tick, players apply the result of any man\oe{}uvres to their speed, then the GM adds each combatant's speed to their position to get their position for the next tick.

If you do not man\oe{}uvre, or you take a man\oe{}uvre that does not otherwise affect your speed, subtract 10 plus your vehicle's \stat{Weight} modifier from your speed. This is \emph{coasting}.

Most man\oe{}uvres cost \emph{fuel}; how much depends on the man\oe{}uvre. You can only man\oe{}uvre if you have enough fuel.
