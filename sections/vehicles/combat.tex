When making a driving-related dice roll, combine your \stat[Driving]{Wit} modifier with the stat modifier from the vehicle. A vehicular attack roll is \combined{\stat[Driving]{Wit}}{\stat{Speed}} versus \combined{\stat[Driving]{Wit}}{\stat{Ruggedness}}.

Vehicles are tracked on the road by their \emph{position}, \emph{speed} and \emph{direction}. Position and direction are always relative. At the end of each tick, players apply the result of any man\oe{}uvres to their speed, then the GM adds each combatant's speed to their position to get their position for the next tick.

If you do not man\oe{}uvre in a tick, or you take a man\oe{}uvre that does not affect your speed, subtract 10 plus your vehicle's \stat{Weight} modifier from your speed.

Most man\oe{}uvres cost \emph{fuel}; how much depends on the man\oe{}uvre. You can only man\oe{}uvre if you have enough fuel.
