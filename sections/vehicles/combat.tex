When making a driving-related dice roll, combine your \stat[Driving]{Wit} modifier with the stat modifier from the vehicle.

Vehicles are tracked on the road by their \emph{position}, \emph{speed} and \emph{direction}. Position and direction are always relative. At the end of each tick, players apply the result of any man\oe{}uvres to their speed, then the GM adds each combatant's speed to their position to get their position for the next tick.

Most man\oe{}uvres cost \emph{fuel}. You can only take these if you have enough fuel. If you don't man\oe{}uvre in a tick, or you take a man\oe{}uvre that doesn't affect your speed, subtract 10 plus your vehicle's \stat{Weight} modifier from your speed.
