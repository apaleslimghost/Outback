A setpiece might include an environmental hazard to man\oe{}vre around: a hairpin bend, a canyon wall, quicksand, that kind of thing. At the start of the setpiece, the GM will declare the hazard, its difficulty from \textbf{-6} to \textbf{+6}, and its consequences.

As the last action in a setpiece, drivers should roll to avoid the hazard, usually \stat{Handling} against its difficulty roll. If the roll fails or the driver doesn't take that action, bad things happen.
