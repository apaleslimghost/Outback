A setpiece might include an environmental hazard: a hairpin bend, a canyon wall, quicksand, that kind of thing. The GM will declare the hazard at the start of the setpiece, and every character must succeed an appropriate roll at the end of the setpiece to surmount the hazard. Consequences for failure depend on the hazard.
