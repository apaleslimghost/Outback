Vehicles have their own stats, separate from characters: \stat{Speed}, \stat{Handling}, \stat{Acceleration}, \stat{Brakes}, \stat{Ruggedness} and \stat{Weight}.

\stat{Speed} is different. It's not 0-20 like a regular stat, but from 0 to your vehicle's \stat{Maximum Speed}, measured in \emph{feet per second}. It changes as you man\oe{}uvre your vehicle. To use it as a stat, divide by 10 (rounding down, i.e.\ just remove the last digit), and find the modifier from the table in Extended Rules.
