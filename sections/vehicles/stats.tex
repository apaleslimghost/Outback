Vehicles have their own stats, separate from characters: \stat{Speed}, \stat{Handling}, \stat{Acceleration}, \stat{Brakes}, \stat{Ruggedness} and \stat{Weight}.

Your character's driving is only as good as their \stat{Wit}. When rolling a for a driving action, you must use the lowest of the vehicle's stat and your \stat{Wit}.
