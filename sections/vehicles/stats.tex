Vehicles have separate sets of stats: \stat{Speed}, \stat{Handling}, \stat{Acceleration}, \stat{Brakes}, \stat{Ruggedness} and \stat{Weight}. Each vehicle part confers stats to the vehicle, and can be upgraded separately.

\stat{Speed} is different. It's not 0-20 like the others, but from 0 to your vehicle's \stat{Maximum Speed}, in \emph{feet per second}. It changes as you man\oe{}uvre your vehicle. Convert it to a 0-20 stat by dividing by 10, and to a modifier from the stat in the usual way.

A vehicle's \stat{Maximum HP} is 5 times its \stat{Ruggedness} stat.
